# MNIST Classification with Keras

This repository contains a basic implementation of a neural network for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Keras.

## Introduction

The neural network model is built using Keras and trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Model Architecture

The neural network architecture consists of the following layers:
- Input Layer
- 3 Hidden Layers (ReLU activation, Dropout with 0.2 probability)
- Output Layer (with softmax activation)

The model is designed to achieve high accuracy and F1 score on the MNIST dataset.

## Implementation

- **File:** `model.py`
  - This file contains the implementation of the neural network model using Keras.
  - The model architecture includes an input layer, three hidden layers, and an output layer with ReLU activation functions and dropout regularization.
  - Categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer are used during model training.
  - The model is trained on the MNIST training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn keras
   ```

3. **Run the Model:**
   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```

4. **Results:**
   - The model's accuracy and F1 score on the MNIST test dataset will be printed.
   - Classification report and confusion matrix will be displayed.

## Performance
The model achieves an F1 score and accuracy of roughly 98-99% on the MNIST dataset.
